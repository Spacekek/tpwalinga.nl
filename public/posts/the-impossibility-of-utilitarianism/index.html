  "articleBody": "(This is a paper I wrote for a philosophy course at University)\nIntroduction “It is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.\"1 It almost sounds like an a priori truth, but it is far from it. It’s the mantra of utilitarianism, the idea that the total amount of happiness2 created by an action determines whether it is good or bad. In this paper, I will argue that it is incorrect for a plethora of reasons.\nWhen should we stop counting Utilitarianism is based on the fact that actions affect the future, so to determine if an action is good (according to utilitarianism) you have got to look at the consequences of the action; if the action causes the total happiness to go up the action is classified as good. But total happiness at what moment? For example, if an action causes total happiness to go up in the short term but to go down in the long term, is it classified as good or bad? Most utilitarians argue that you have to look at the long term, but the same problem holds, when should they stop counting? It is impossible to count or predict happiness accurately for an infinite amount of time and space; this is because our universe is a chaotic system; it is almost impossible to predict (even in the short term). A great story to illustrate the importance of the time frame for consequentialist ethics is this Taoist koan3 about an old farmer:\n“One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. “Such bad luck,” they said sympathetically.\n“Maybe,” the farmer replied.\nThe next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How wonderful,” the neighbors exclaimed.\n“Maybe,” replied the old man.\nThe following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy for what they called his “misfortune.\"\n“Maybe,” answered the farmer.\nThe day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men into the army. Seeing that the son’s leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out.\n“Maybe,” said the farmer.\"\nAt each point in time, the neighbors make a judgment, but each time they could be wrong. If a utilitarian argues that some amount of time is enough, it is like the neighbors in the story making a judgment based on what has happened so far, different things could still happen.\nThe nature of happiness The previous section assumed that happiness is objective and can be calculated with, so another problem for utilitarianism is that happiness is not a straightforward objective thing. For example, there could be multiple kinds of happiness. Some individuals might prefer spiritual fulfillment in the form of asceticism, while others prioritize sensory pleasures in the form of hedonism (most prefer a bit of both). If the definition of happiness varies between individuals, it becomes even more difficult to measure the happiness an action provides. For utilitarianism to work, the calculation of happiness has to be possible; if the definition of happiness is subjective, then this calculation becomes problematic.\nHow to count happiness A similar problem is provided by John Taurek’s “Should the Numbers Count?” he argues that he values the life of another not because it has an objective value but because he can empathize with the person in question. “Five individuals each losing his life does not add up to anyone’s experiencing a loss five times greater than the loss suffered by any one of the five.” The loss to the individual can’t be added up to a bigger loss because it would no longer be the loss to the individual; there is no greater loss to an individual spared by saving more individuals.4 This means that the loss or happiness of individuals can not be added up in the way needed for utilitarianism.\nBalancing conflicting variables Let’s say that we found a way to solve the above-mentioned problems, there is still another problem: What should be maximized? Utilitarianism states that the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest amount of individuals should be maximized. However these are two variables which could prove problematic. For example, if we can do an action that provides great happiness for a few individuals or an action that provides a small amount of happiness for a lot of individuals, which one should we prefer? If happiness is quantifiable, the average could be multiplied by the number of individuals, but how can we know that one should not be preferred over the other? If happiness is felt on a logarithmic scale, we should prefer the second, but if it is an exponential scale, we should prefer the first, but we have no way of knowing which is the case.\nWho counts Until now we have only discussed “individuals,” but who is meant by this? Only animals of the Homo Sapiens genus? Sam Harris argues that all conscious creatures should count5, but this generates a host of different problems. For example, how can we figure out if something is conscious? If consciousness is a spectrum, should that be accounted for? If, for example, a cockroach is a little conscious but feels happiness intensely, should the cockroach be counted more or less towards “the well-being of conscious creatures?\"6 Also, because we have no way to know how other beings feel, there is no way to tell if the brain activity we see in their brains is really a feeling of happiness. Just by observing and reducing everything, we never really understand the feeling; this is also what Thomas Nagel argues in his famous paper “What is it like to be a bat.” To further illustrate, I will explain his thought experiment: Try to imagine being a bat, you can try to picture how it would be but cannot know for sure that a bat experiences life in that way and it is always from our perspective; we try to imagine the echolocation as a visual sense, but it could be that they experience it in a totally different way. We could look at how the bat’s brain works, know everything that happens inside it, but we still won’t know what it is like to be a bat.7 So when we maximize the brain activity that we think is happiness in other individuals we could be making their experience of life worse!\nThe nonexistence of an objective viewpoint Utilitarianism assumes the possibility of objectively measuring an individual’s happiness, but the happiness is inherently subjective. Happiness is desirable for the individual, but that does not necessarily translate to the average or total happiness being more desirable; the desirability of happiness is still individual and only exists within us; you cannot feel other people’s happiness. So if happiness is good for the individual, that does not say whether a higher “total happiness\" between multiple individuals is good.\nThe is-ought gap At the heart of utilitarianism is the assumption that happiness is good and that we should act accordingly. David Hume calls out these assumptions at the basis of all ethics in what is now called the “is-ought gap.” There is no way to bridge the gap between what is and what ought to be done without making unprovable assumptions.8 There is no way to go from only descriptive statements to normative statements because these are entirely different. This gap means that all objective normative ethics (of which utilitarianism is one) cannot prove that we ought to act according to their views.\nConclusion All these arguments mean that utilitarianism is impossible in every way. The calculation is impossible because you can not calculate it for an infinite amount of time and space. There is no clear definition of happiness. There is no way to do math with happiness, and even if you could do math with happiness, it is not clear which, how, and why one of the variables should be preferred over the other in the maximization. Furthermore, we have no way of knowing which individuals we should count towards the total happiness or how much. Even if we could, we would not be able to measure it objectively because it is an individual experience. Finally, the is-ought gap shows that even the fundamental assumption that happiness is good cannot be proven. It is important for us to continue to critically evaluate existing theories to gain insight into what theories are the best and how to improve them. All the limitations and challenges make utilitarianism impossible to implement and fail as a theory for moral decisions.\n  Bentham, Jeremy.

<p>Utilitarianism is based on the fact that actions affect the future, so
to determine if an action is good (according to utilitarianism) you have
got to look at the consequences of the action; if the action causes the
total happiness to go up the action is classified as good. But total
happiness at what moment? For example, if an action causes total
happiness to go up in the short term but to go down in the long term, is
it classified as good or bad? Most utilitarians argue that you have to
look at the long term, but the same problem holds, when should they stop
counting? It is impossible to count or predict happiness accurately for
an infinite amount of time and space; this is because our universe is a
chaotic system; it is almost impossible to predict (even in the short
term). A great story to illustrate the importance of the time frame for
consequentialist ethics is this Taoist koan<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> about an old farmer:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came
to visit. &ldquo;Such bad luck,&rdquo; they said sympathetically.<br>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; the farmer replied.<br>
The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild
horses. &ldquo;How wonderful,&rdquo; the neighbors exclaimed.<br>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; replied the old man.<br>
The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was
thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their
sympathy for what they called his &ldquo;misfortune.&quot;<br>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; answered the farmer.<br>
The day after, military officials came to the village to draft young men
into the army. Seeing that the son&rsquo;s leg was broken, they passed him by.
The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned
out.<br>
&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said the farmer.&quot;</em><br>
<br>
At each point in time, the neighbors make a judgment, but each time they
could be wrong. If a utilitarian argues that some amount of time is

what has happened so far, different things could still happen.</p>

<p>A similar problem is provided by John Taurek&rsquo;s &ldquo;Should the Numbers
Count?&rdquo; he argues that he values the life of another not because it has
an objective value but because he can empathize with the person in
question. &ldquo;Five individuals each losing his life does not add up to
anyone&rsquo;s experiencing a loss five times greater than the loss suffered
by any one of the five.&rdquo; The loss to the individual can&rsquo;t be added up to
a bigger loss because it would no longer be the loss to the individual;
there is no greater loss to an individual spared by saving more
individuals.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> This means that the loss or happiness of individuals
can not be added up in the way needed for utilitarianism.</p>

should not be preferred over the other? If happiness is felt on a
logarithmic scale, we should prefer the second, but if it is an
exponential scale, we should prefer the first, but we have no way of
knowing which is the case.</p>
<h1 id="who-counts">Who counts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#who-counts">#</a></h1>
<p>Until now we have only discussed &ldquo;individuals,&rdquo; but who is meant by
this? Only animals of the Homo Sapiens genus? Sam Harris argues that all
conscious creatures should count<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, but this generates a host of
different problems. For example, how can we figure out if something is
conscious? If consciousness is a spectrum, should that be accounted for?
If, for example, a cockroach is a little conscious but feels happiness
intensely, should the cockroach be counted more or less towards &ldquo;the

Happiness is desirable for the individual, but that does not necessarily
translate to the average or total happiness being more desirable; the
desirability of happiness is still individual and only exists within us;
you cannot feel other people&rsquo;s happiness. So if happiness is good for
the individual, that does not say whether a higher &ldquo;total happiness&quot;
between multiple individuals is good.</p>
<h1 id="the-is-ought-gap">The is-ought gap<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-is-ought-gap">#</a></h1>
<p>At the heart of utilitarianism is the assumption that happiness is good
and that we should act accordingly. David Hume calls out these
assumptions at the basis of all ethics in what is now called the
&ldquo;is-ought gap.&rdquo; There is no way to bridge the gap between what is and
what ought to be done without making unprovable assumptions.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> There
is no way to go from only descriptive statements to normative statements
because these are entirely different. This gap means that all objective
normative ethics (of which utilitarianism is one) cannot prove that we
ought to act according to their views.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>All these arguments mean that utilitarianism is impossible in every way.
The calculation is impossible because you can not calculate it for an
infinite amount of time and space. There is no clear definition of
happiness. There is no way to do math with happiness, and even if you
could do math with happiness, it is not clear which, how, and why one of
the variables should be preferred over the other in the maximization.
Furthermore, we have no way of knowing which individuals we should count
towards the total happiness or how much. Even if we could, we would not
be able to measure it objectively because it is an individual
experience. Finally, the is-ought gap shows that even the fundamental
assumption that happiness is good cannot be proven. It is important for
us to continue to critically evaluate existing theories to gain insight
into what theories are the best and how to improve them. All the
limitations and challenges make utilitarianism impossible to implement
and fail as a theory for moral decisions.</p>
